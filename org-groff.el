;; This library implements a Groff exporter for org-mode.

;; It is part of Org and will be autoloaded

  "Alist of Groff classes and associated header and structure.
If #+Groff_CLASS is set in the buffer, use its value and the
associated information.  Here is the structure of each cell:

  \(class-name
    header-string
    (numbered-section . unnumbered-section\)
    ...\)

The header string
-----------------

The HEADER-STRING is the header that will be inserted into the Groff file.
To this header, the following commands will be added:

- Assigns for all packages mentioned in the variables
  `org-export-groff-default-packages-alist' and
  `org-export-groff-packages-alist'.  Thus, your header definitions should
  avoid to also request these packages.

- Lines specified via \"#+Groff_HEADER:\"

If you need more control about the sequence in which the header is built
up, or if you want to exclude one of these building blocks for a particular
class, you can use the following macro-like placeholders.

 [DEFAULT-PACKAGES]      \\usepackage statements for default packages
 [NO-DEFAULT-PACKAGES]   do not include any of the default packages
 [PACKAGES]              \\usepackage statements for packages
 [NO-PACKAGES]           do not include the packages
 [EXTRA]                 the stuff from #+Groff_HEADER
 [NO-EXTRA]              do not include #+Groff_HEADER stuff
 [BEAMER-HEADER-EXTRA]   the beamer extra headers

So a header like

  \\documentclass{article}
  [NO-DEFAULT-PACKAGES]
  [EXTRA]
  \\providecommand{\\alert}[1]{\\textbf{#1}}
  [PACKAGES]

will omit the default packages, and will include the #+Groff_HEADER lines,
then have a call to \\providecommand, and then place \\usepackage commands
based on the content of `org-export-groff-packages-alist'.

If your header or `org-export-groff-default-packages-alist' inserts
\"\\usepackage[AUTO]{inputenc}\", AUTO will automatically be replaced with
a coding system derived from `buffer-file-coding-system'.  See also the
variable `org-export-groff-inputenc-alist' for a way to influence this
mechanism.

The sectioning structure
------------------------

The sectioning structure of the class is given by the elements following
the header string.  For each sectioning level, a number of strings is
specified.  A %s formatter is mandatory in each section string and will
be replaced by the title of the section.

Instead of a cons cell (numbered . unnumbered), you can also provide a list
of 2 or 4 elements,

  (numbered-open numbered-close)

or

  (numbered-open numbered-close unnumbered-open unnumbered-close)

providing opening and closing strings for a Groff environment that should
represent the document section.  The opening clause should have a %s
to represent the section title.

Instead of a list of sectioning commands, you can also specify a
function name.  That function will be called with two parameters,
the (reduced) level of the headline, and the headline text.  The function
must return a cons cell with the (possibly modified) headline text, and the
sectioning list in the cdr."

The reason why this is a list is that it usually takes several runs of
`pdfgroff', maybe mixed with a call to `bibtex'.  Org does not have a clever
mechanism to detect which of these commands have to be run to get to a stable
result, and it also does not do any error checking.

By default, Org uses 3 runs of `pdfgroff' to do the processing.  If you
have texi2dvi on your system and if that does not cause the infamous
egrep/locale bug:

     http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-texinfo/2010-03/msg00031.html

then `texi2dvi' is the superior choice.  Org does offer it as one
of the customize options.

could use this to apply the machinery of AUCTeX or the Emacs Groff mode.
