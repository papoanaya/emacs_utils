emacs_utils
===========

Emacs Lisp Ulitities that I have developed during the course of using
the editor. These are for my own use but feel free to use them as
required.

- regina.el : Rexx mode, which is a mash up of netrexx.el and
  rexx.el. In this way I have an electric mode with syntax highlight for
  developing REXX scripts.
- muse-mm.el : Muse mode for GROFF memorandum mamros (mm).  Even though
  muse already has a groff mode, it uses the MOM and WWW macros. This
  combination seems to be geared to literature. The MM macros are 
  catered for professional communications. These may be rough around the
  edges but they work good enough for me. I worked with these macros
  for many years. 
- mantislib.el : Copy of jira2.el library for the Mantis bug tracking
  system.  It is still in development, but getting there. These can be 
  used in combination of other tools for access of Mantis tickets. 
  
  This is still a work in progress.
